"Hotspot main goal is to provide internet connectivity via wi-fi to casual"

" network by authenticating themselves via social login, sms, email or a "
"voucher code. The hotspot service allows the regulation, accountability "
"and pricing of Internet access in public places, like squares, hotels, "
