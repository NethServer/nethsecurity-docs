"The Netify Agent functions as a deep-packet inspection server, leveraging"
" nDPI (formerly OpenDPI) to identify network protocols and applications. "
"Detected information can be stored locally, accessed through UNIX or TCP "
"sockets, or sent via HTTP POSTs to a remote third-party server. Details "
"such as flow metadata, network statistics, and detection classifications "
"can be used to take decision on the flow."
