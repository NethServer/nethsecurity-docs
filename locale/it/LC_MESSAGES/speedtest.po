"The Speedtest tool is a widely used application for measuring the speed "
"and performance of an internet connection. It provides users with "
"detailed information about their download and upload speeds, as well as "
"their ping and jitter. This tool is essential for diagnosing network "
"issues, verifying service provider claims, and ensuring optimal "
"performance for various online activities."
