"Network Address Translation (NAT) is used to modify network address "
"information in packet headers while in transit. NAT primarily enables the"
" translation of private IP addresses used within a local network to a "
"public IP address, allowing multiple devices within the local network to "
"share a single public IP when accessing the internet. As default, all "
"hosts within the local network access the WAN using the firewall are "
"using masquerade. Masquerade is a form of NAT that automatically assigns "
"the source IP address of outgoing packets to the WAN IP address of the "
"firewall. This ensures that internal hosts accessing the internet appear "
"to external servers as if they are originating from the firewall's public"
" IP address."

"Source NAT, often referred to as SNAT, modifies the source IP address of "
