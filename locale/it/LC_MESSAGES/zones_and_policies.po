"Firewall zones categorize network interfaces, defining trust boundaries, "
"while firewall rules dictate traffic handling between zones. Zones "
"organize network segments, and rules enforce security policies by "
"specifying conditions for permitted or denied actions. Together, they "
"allow the definition and application of rules for network traffic within "
"the firewall."

"In a firewall system, zones and policies are fundamental concepts that "
"help manage network security by controlling the flow of traffic between "
"different segments of a network. A zone in a firewall represents a "
"specific network segment with its own level of trustworthiness. For "
"instance, a common setup might include zones like WAN (Wide Area Network)"
" representing the external, untrusted network (usually the internet) and "
"LAN (Local Area Network) representing the internal, trusted network "
"(devices within a private home or organization). Each zone has its own "
"set of security rules and policies that dictate how traffic can flow to "
"and from that zone."

"Policies in a firewall define the rules and actions that determine how "
