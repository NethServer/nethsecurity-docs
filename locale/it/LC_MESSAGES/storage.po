"As default, logs are written in a volatile in-memory directory to prevent"
" errors on the root file system in case of failure. The memory storage "
"capacity is limited and the oldest logs are automatically removed as time"
" passes to limit memory occupancy. However, if you reboot the system or "
"your system fails, you may lose all of your logs."

"NethSecurity allows you to save a copy of system logs to a storage device"
" other than the one it's currently on, like a USB stick or an additional "
"hard drive. Additionally, if the disk containing the operating system has"
" unallocated space, NethSecurity allows you to leverage this space as "
"data storage. This provides a convenient and efficient way to utilize "
"existing resources for expanding storage capacity without the need for "
"additional external devices."
