"Snort 3 is an open-source network Intrusion Prevention System that is "
"capable of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP"
" networks. It can perform protocol analysis, content searching/matching, "
"and can be used to detect a variety of attacks and probes, such as buffer"
