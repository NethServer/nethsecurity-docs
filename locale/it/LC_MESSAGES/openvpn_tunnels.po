"To connect two firewalls via an OpenVPN tunnel, first configure the "
"server firewall, then configure the client one. The server needs at least"
" one public IP address to be reachable by the client, while the client "
"may not even have public IPs. The configuration of the firewall server "
"requires only a very few parameters, where possible all the parameters "
"are already filled in automatically to avoid errors and speed up the "
"process. Once the server firewall has been configured, it will be "
"possible to download the client configuration to import onto the other "
"firewall."
