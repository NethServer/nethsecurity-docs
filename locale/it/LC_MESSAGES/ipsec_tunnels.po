"IPsec (IP Security) protocol is the ‘de facto’ standard in VPN tunnels, "
"it’s typically used to create net to net tunnels and it’s supported from "
"all manufacturers. You can use this protocol to create VPN tunnels "
"between a NethSecurity and a device from another manufacturer as well as "
"VPN tunnels between 2 NethSecurity."
