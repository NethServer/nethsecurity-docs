"The connection tracking (Conntrack) is a network feature used in "
"firewalls and routers to monitor and manage the state of active network "
"connections. It tracks the state of each connection, such as new, "
"established, related, or expired, and maintains this information in a "
"connection tracking table. This allows for stateful packet inspection, "
"where packets are inspected based on their connection context, enabling "
"more precise and secure filtering rules. Conntrack also supports Network "
"Address Translation (NAT) by tracking internal to external IP mappings "
"and optimizes performance by quickly dropping packets from invalid or "
"expired connections."
