"MultiWAN (Wide Area Network) configuration is a setup in which the "
"firewall utilizes multiple internet connections from different internet "
"service providers (ISPs) simultaneously. This configuration aims to "
"enhance network reliability, increase bandwidth, and improve internet "
"speed by distributing network traffic across multiple links. It can "
"provide failover protection, ensuring that if one connection fails, the "
"network traffic is automatically redirected to the functional connection,"
" minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous internet access. MultiWAN "
"configurations are often used in businesses and organizations that "
"require a highly available and stable internet connection for their "
"operations."

"MultiWAN configuration requires at least two network interfaces in the "

"The first time you access the configuration page, it is mandatory to "
