"NethSecurity QoS is designed to make the best use of available bandwidth,"
" without imposing strict limits or shaping traffic by default. It "
"operates on the following principles:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../qos.rst:13 591b4e35ee874af7a2aec0d5b87572af
msgid ""
"*Bandwidth usage*: QoS strives to utilize the available bandwidth to its "
"fullest potential. By default, it does not impose strict bandwidth "
"limitations on your network. Instead, it dynamically adjusts to network "
"conditions, ensuring that unused bandwidth is efficiently utilized."
msgstr ""

#: ../../qos.rst:16 19999de7c2c2433c9c06635b990dc4a2

"*Flow management*: QoS actively manages network flows to prevent any "
"single client or application from monopolizing the available bandwidth. "
"This ensures fair and equitable access to network resources for all "
"users."

"Bandwidth management is handled dynamically and automatically by the "

" download bandwidth values for each interface under QoS."

"QoS relies on an eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) based classifier "
"to set Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) fields in packets. This "
"classification helps prioritize and manage network traffic efficiently. "
"To maximize efficiency, QoS operates in the kernel space using eBPF "
"technology. This ensures minimal overhead and minimal impact on system "
"performance. In addition to IP and port-based rules, QoS allows you to "
"define traffic rules based on DNS names, providing granular control over "
"how traffic is classified and treated."
