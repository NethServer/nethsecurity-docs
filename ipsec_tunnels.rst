   This feature is still under development and does not have a user interface yet. It can currently only be configured through the command line.


IPsec tunnels, are a crucial component of modern network security. 
These tunnels provide a secure and encrypted communication pathway over the internet or any untrusted network, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit. 

NethSecurity by default uses Route-Based VPNs, see the `Openwrt Manual <https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/vpn/strongswan/site2site>`_ for more info on manual configuration.
