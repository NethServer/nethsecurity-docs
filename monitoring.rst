Monitoring
==========

NethSecurity provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities to help administrators track the performance and health of the firewall.
Monitoring is essential for ensuring the firewall's optimal operation and identifying potential issues that may impact its functionality.

NethSecurity offers two types of monitoring:

- **Real-time monitoring**: it leverages Netdata to provide immediate insights into the firewall's performance.
  It reads data from logs and local databases, storing metrics in RAM. Note that these metrics are reset upon every reboot, ensuring that only the most current data are displayed.
- **Historical monitoring**: for a more comprehensive view over time, historical monitoring stores data on a remote controller.
  This allows metrics to be preserved across reboots and enables centralized monitoring. Please note that this feature requires a valid subscription both on the firewall and the controller.

and click :guilabel:`Open report` button from the ``Real-time report`` tab.

Netdata metrics are saved in RAM and will be reset at very machine reboot.
If the firewall is connected to the :ref:`remote controller <controller-section>`, metrics will be stored to the controller itself and preserved across reboots.

.. _ping_latency-section:

Ping latency monitoring
------------------------

Configure the monitoring tool to evaluate round-trip time and packet loss by transmitting ping messages to network hosts.
This tool is employed to monitor the quality of network connectivity. You have the option to include one or more hosts for monitoring,
and it's also feasible to add IP addresses within a VPN for assessing tunnel quality.

To monitor a new host or IP address, click on the :guilabel:`Add host` button and enter the required information,
finally click on the :guilabel:`Save` button to confirm the changes.

Changes are applied immediately. To remove a host from the list, click on the delete icon.

You can see a graph of the ping latency by accessing Netdata from the report page.

.. _historical_monitoring-section:

Historical monitoring
=====================

.. admonition:: Subscription required

   This feature is available only if the firewall and the controller have a valid subscription.

If the unit was connected to the controller before the subscription was activated, historical monitoring will not be enabled automatically.
The ``Controller`` page will show a message indicating that historical monitoring is disabled.

To enable it, follow these steps:

1. Disconnect the unit from the controller.
2. Ensure that the NethServer 8 where the controller is installed has a valid subscription.
3. Reconnect the unit to the controller.

See the :ref:`controller metrics <controller_metrics-section>` for more information.

.. _alert-section:

Alerts
======

The alert system leverages the power of the Netdata engine for efficient monitoring and alerting.

The alert system prioritizes only those alerts that have the potential to disrupt or compromise the firewall's functionality.
By focusing on critical indicators, administrators can efficiently address issues that pose a genuine threat to the security and operation of the firewall.

If the server has a valid :ref:`subscription-section`, alert notifications are seamlessly sent to remote servers for centralized monitoring and management.
Both ``my.nethesis.it`` and ``my.nethserver.com`` serve as central hubs for receiving alerts, allowing administrators to stay informed about the firewall's
status and promptly respond to any critical situations.

Implemented alerts:

- Disk Space: the disk space alert triggers when available disk space on the system reaches a critical level.
  This proactive notification helps prevent potential disruptions by addressing disk space issues before they impact firewall operations.

- MultiWAN Status (Up/Down): this alert notifies administrators when there are changes in the MultiWAN status, indicating whether connections are up or down.
  Timely awareness of MultiWAN status changes is crucial for maintaining continuous and reliable internet connectivity.
