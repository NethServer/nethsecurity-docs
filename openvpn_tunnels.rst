OpenVPN tunnels
===============

.. warning::

   This feature is still under development and does not have a user interface yet. It can currently only be configured through the command line.

OpenVPN net-to-net tunnels establish secure connections between two separate networks, such as branch offices of a company, over the internet.
These connections use SSL/TLS protocols for encryption and authentication, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.

See the `developer manual <https://dev.nethsecurity.org/packages/ns-openvpn/#openvpn-tunnels>`_ for more info on manual configuration.
